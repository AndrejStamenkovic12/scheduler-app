### **Bug #2: Inconsistent Script Loading**
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Impact:** Code duplication, harder maintenance

- hair_providers.html (had inline script)
- eyebrow_providers.html (had inline script)
- nail_providers.html (missing script entirely)

### **Bug #3: Appointment Type Storage Issue**
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Severity:** High
**Issue:** Appointments were being stored with keys ("hair", "nails") instead of display names ("Hair Salon", "Nail Salon")
**Impact:** Appointment displays would show keys instead of proper service names
**Location:** `app.py` - `add_appointment()` route

**Fix Applied:**
- Added conversion from key to display name before storing
- Now converts "hair" ‚Üí "Hair Salon", "nails" ‚Üí "Nail Salon", etc.
- Uses `scheduler.appointment_types.get()` to lookup proper name

**Code Change:**
```python
# Before
appointment_type = request.form.get('type')
scheduler.add_appointment(appointment_type, ...)

# After
appointment_type_key = request.form.get('type')
appointment_type = scheduler.appointment_types.get(appointment_type_key, appointment_type_key)
scheduler.add_appointment(appointment_type, ...)
```

### **Bug #4: Insecure Secret Key**
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Severity:** High (Security)
**Issue:** Flask secret key was hardcoded as 'your-secret-key-change-this'
**Impact:** Session security vulnerability, predictable secret key
**Location:** `app.py` line 11

**Fix Applied:**
- Generate secure random secret key using `secrets.token_hex(32)`
- Falls back to environment variable `SECRET_KEY` if set
- More secure for production use

**Code Change:**
```python
# Before
app.secret_key = 'your-secret-key-change-this'

# After
import secrets
app.secret_key = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', secrets.token_hex(32))
```

### **Bug #5: Provider Service Category Mismatch**
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Severity:** High
**Issue:** Provider routes were checking for old generic categories (hair_beauty, wellness_spa) instead of specific types (hair_salon, nail_salon)
**Impact:** Registered providers wouldn't appear on their service pages
**Files Affected:** All 15 provider route functions in app.py

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated all provider routes to check for specific service categories
- hair_beauty ‚Üí hair_salon, nail_salon, eyebrow_eyelash
- wellness_spa ‚Üí massage_therapy, spa_treatment, aromatherapy  
- fitness ‚Üí personal_training, yoga_classes, pilates
- medical_health ‚Üí dermatology, physical_therapy, nutrition_counseling
- creative_professional ‚Üí makeup_artist, photography, life_coaching
